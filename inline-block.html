summary:
block element => In HTML programming, a block-level element is  
                 any element that starts a new line (e.g., paragraph) and uses the full width of the page or container. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element. Example - p, h1, h2 tag and more ect
inline element => Inline elements display in a line. They do not 
                  force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. Example strong, b, i, em tag and more etc.
